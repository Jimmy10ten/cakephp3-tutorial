##   CAKEPHP TUTORIAL

##   This tutorial will walk you through the basics of creating a simple blog
##   application using CakePHP 3.0. We'll assume you have a working knowledge of
##   PHP and MySQL.

##   ## Installation via composer

##   The easiest way to install CakePHP is to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
##   If you don't have Composer installed, you can download a copy here: [composer.phar](http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar).

##   Once you have composer installed, run the following command from your project
##   directory to install CakePHP:
```bash
composer self-update && composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app:"^3.10" cms
```
